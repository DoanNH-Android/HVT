    <string name="more_information_content">In Android, working with images(bitmaps) is really difficult as the application goes out of memory(OOM) very frequently. OOM is the biggest nightmare for the Android developers.
We all Android developers are very fortunate that we live in the world of open-source. I too love open-source as much as you love. I have got everything from Android community, so I always want to give something from my side by sharing my knowledge with all of you.</string>
